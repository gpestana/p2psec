## A Survey on Routing in Anonymous Communication Protocols
**Fatemeh Shirazi, Milivoj Simeonovski, Muhammad Rizwan Asghar**

**what**: survey of previous research on designing, developing, and deploying 
systems for anonymous communication

**results**: a new taxonomy for different routing strategies (DHT, Mixnets,
etc..) that takes into consideration its performance and anonymity

**importance**: overview of performance and anonymity in P2P routing
mechanisms and a framework to discuss and measure different mechanisms regarding
their performance and anonymity levels. A systematic understanding and
classification of routing protocols is important in order to compare, evaluate
and improve anonymous routing mechanisms.


**design characteristics of routing mechanisms**: 
- network structure: 
- routing information:
- communication model:
