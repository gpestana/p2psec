## HORNET: High-speed Onion Routing at the Network Layer
**Chen Chen, et al.**

**what**: system for high-speed, e2e anonymous channels at the network (router) layer. it proposes a onion routing scheme in which relays do not keep state of the channels - the state is carried in the payload - and studies the trade-offs between those approaches.

**results**: design and implementation of HORNET, which provides stronger anonymity that existing network-level schemes; performance of the scheme is comparable with high-end commodity routers;

**importance**: anonymous communication protocol with good performance and scalability at a network level is a great improvement to nowadays state of art and it would provide developers and users better anonymity and privacy out of the box.

---

**goals**: design a network-level routing scheme that is secure against mass surveillance (relationship anonymity), supporting both sender anonymity or sender-receiver anonymity.
